# OpenDnD
This framework was developed to be able to have a highly simplified set of tools for creating fantasy miniatures and having them battle using dice to simulate randomness. The idea was that anyone could get a miniature, paint it, take a picture of it, add it to the template and give it status, attributes, and a backstory, and, print out the card, and use it in a game with others. 

# Tools
All of the software tools used in this process are entirely open source.
Libre Office Draw - is used to editing the cards
GIMP - is used for image manipulation
